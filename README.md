# Online Operations Security (OpSec)
Threat models and tools for staying safe, private and informed while Online, used by the average person.

*Until the first draft of this document is finished (sometime before 02/01/2021), it will be updated daily.*

## Introduction
OpSec or Operations Security can be defined (when referring to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_security)) as a, "*...process that identifies critical information to determine if friendly actions can be observed by enemy intelligence, determines if information obtained by adversaries could be interpreted to be useful to them, and then executes selected measures that eliminate or reduce adversary exploitation of friendly critical information.*" All of which can be applied to the physical and/or digital worlds.

Online OpSec, for the individual Internet user, is quite a serious topic and best to be treated as such.

The purpose of this document therefore is to organize useful context (in the form of information about threat modeling) and tools (most of which are free) for staying safe, private and informed while Online. If a resource mentioned herein does require one to spend money for access, said tool is assuredly both low-cost and high-return.

### Quintessentials
Before diving into the world(s) of Online OpSec, it's important to understand what is at risk; more accurately, it's important to understand what we value.

The substance of this document can help the individual maintain their safety, privacy and access to information above other states or pursuits. To help explain, below is an overview of what *safe*, *private* and *informed* mean.

#### Safe
To be safe (when referencing [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety)) means to be, "*...protected from harm or other non-desirable outcomes. Safety can also refer to the control of recognized hazards in order to achieve an acceptable level of risk.*"

#### Private
To be private (according to the [IAPP](https://iapp.org/about/what-is-privacy/)) means to be, "*...let alone, or [to have] freedom from interference or intrusion.*"

#### Informed
To be informed (as mentioned on [Merriam-Webster.com](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/well-informed)) means to be especially, "*...knowledgeable in a particular subject[.]*"

To be informed is to be aware of properties and their value(s).

### Relevancy
The need to remain secure when using the Internet is relevant to everyone; regardless of who, what, why, how, where and/or when one is.

Moving forward, threat models are covered first, followed by specific tools; ever reaching for that meta (yet granular) agency, an ideal state indeed.

## Threat Models
A threat model is a structured and systematic means by which individuals can identify potential vulnerabilities, understand the implications of each and respond accordingly in order to mitigate damage. The intention behind threat modeling, as mentioned on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threat_model), is to offer an, "*...analysis of what controls or defenses need to be included, given the nature of the system, the probable attacker's profile, the most likely attack vectors, and the assets most desired by an attacker.*" In other words, designing a threat model is the conducting of an organized review of one's current situation and possible/foreseeable future dangers therein.

The objective for deploying a threat model is to determing what can go wrong inside a given set of variables; enabling the modeler to gain tactical advantages that might have otherwise been missed.

Below you will find a growing number of threat modeling techniques that can be applied to anyone's situation Online.

### STRIDE
STRIDE (originally introduced by Microsoft) is an acronym representing six different types of threats, each tied to a desired/alternative state or property:
* Spoofing / Authenticity
* Tampering / Integrity
* Repudiation / Non-Repudiability
* Information Disclosure / Confidentiality
* Denial Of Service / Availability
* Elevation Of Privilege / Authorization

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STRIDE_(security)), STRIDE is typically applied when attempting to, "*...find threats to a system. It is used in conjunction with a model of the target system that can be constructed in parallel. This includes a full breakdown of processes, data stores, data flows and trust boundaries.*" The STRIDE model is popular because it is effective, but that relevancy (as mentioned by [Kevin Poniatowski](https://blog.securityinnovation.com/stride)) has been waning.

#### Specific Threats

What follows are the six different threats (as outline above) that the STRIDE model examines in detail.

##### Spoofing
Misrepresenting one's identity, whether that of a person or computer.

##### Tampering
Unauthorized changes made.

##### Repudiation
Leaving no trail or details of illegal or unauthroized activity.

##### Information Disclosure
Gaining access to private and/or secure information without proper authority.

##### Denial Of Service
Preventing intended users from having access to a resource.

##### Elevation Of Privilege
Unauthorized expansion of abilities as a user.

#### Conclusion
The STRIDE threat model is especially useful for personal Online Operations Security.
